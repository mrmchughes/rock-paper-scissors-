I made a Rock Paper Scissors game for the Odin Project. During the game, the player uses the buttons to make their choice each round, and the computer uses a randomized choice selected from out of an array. 

The game proceeds until either the player or the computer wins 3 times. A score display keeps track of the total wins, and a message at the bottom shows the results for each round. A reset button is available below the choice buttons to reset the score, so the player can choose to play again.
